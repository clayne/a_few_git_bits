WIP branches are useful

    * branch off you branch (and even branch off that)
    * and then squash merge back onto your original branch
    * reword the commit message as necessary
    * gitlab (et al?) won't permit merge of any WIP branches
    * yeah you can rebase instead, we will get to that
