branches

    * branch lots!
    * no really, lots!
    * LOTS DAMMIT!
    * you'll need to keep track, so:
        * git branch -vv # better than git branch
        * git-wtf and git-publish-branch

git-wtf

    * originally: https://github.com/michaelklishin/git-wtf
        * my fork is at: https://github.com/leejo/git-tools

    * at a glance view of branch status
        * merged / not merged
        * local only / remote
        * commits 
        * age

    * can take a ~/.git-wtfrc file for config
        * defined the integration branches
        * match only specific branches (maybe i added that feature...)

git-publish-branch

    * easy publish/revoke of branches to the remote

    * git-publish-branch -d <branch_name>
        * locally

    * git-publish-branch -D <branch_name>
        * remotely

    * better than git push origin :<branch_name>
    * or even git push origin --delete <branch_name>
        * is that even correct? i've been using git-publish-branch for so long...
